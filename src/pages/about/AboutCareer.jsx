            <h2>Career</h2>

            <p>
                Much of my career has been focused on supporting and modernizing the Warfighter Information Network – Tactical
                (WIN-T) program, working with both General Dynamics and ManTech International.
            </p>

            <p>
                In these roles, I’ve led software teams responsible for delivering quarterly system updates—coordinating
                development, testing, security fixes, configuration, and release media across complex environments.
            </p>

            <h3>Automation &amp; Testing Focus</h3>

            <p>
                A major focus of my work has been automated testing and system validation. I developed and extended automated
                test frameworks using EggPlant, and later designed <strong>Heimdall</strong>, an in-house automation tool that
                replaced expensive proprietary solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This work reduced testing time, improved coverage, and lowered long-term costs—while giving engineers better
                visibility into system behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>Systems &amp; Field Experience</h3>

            <p>
                Beyond development, I’ve supported field exercises and deployed environments, troubleshooting real-world
                failures under real constraints. That hands-on exposure has heavily influenced how I design software:
                defensive, observable, and built to survive imperfect conditions.
