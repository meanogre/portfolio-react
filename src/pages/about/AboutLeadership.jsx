            <h2>Leadership</h2>

            <p>
                Throughout my career, I’ve often served as a technical lead—coordinating developers, testers, system engineers,
                and stakeholders to deliver reliable results on fixed schedules.
            </p>

            <p>
                I take pride in being the person teams turn to when systems behave unexpectedly or when a problem doesn’t fit
                neatly into one discipline. My leadership style is pragmatic and collaborative: understand the system, reduce
                uncertainty, and move forward deliberately.
            </p>
