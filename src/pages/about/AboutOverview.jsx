            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
                I’m a software engineer with decades of experience building, maintaining, and automating systems where
                failure isn’t an option.
            </p>

            <p>
                My background spans software development, infrastructure, automated testing, and field-deployed systems—often
                all at the same time. I gravitate toward work where correctness, repeatability, and long-term maintainability
                matter more than trends or buzzwords.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve spent most of my career working on large, long-lived systems, helping teams deliver reliable updates,
                reduce risk, and replace fragile manual processes with automation that actually works.
            </p>
