                Systems should be understandable, testable, and resilient—especially when they outlive their original authors.
                I favor designs that make failure obvious, reduce manual intervention, and allow future engineers to reason
                about behavior without guesswork.

                Automation plays a central role in this philosophy. If a process is repeated, it should be scripted. If it’s
                scripted, it should be tested. And if it’s tested, it should be trusted.
